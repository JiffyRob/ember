# Installation

```
pip install ember
```

# Dependencies

Requires:

- Python 3.9 or later.

- Either [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) >= 2.1.4 or [Pygame CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) >= 2.1.4. At some point in the future, we will **only** be supporting Pygame CE.

- Either [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (any recent version should be fine) or [Pygame CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) >= 2.2.0 is required to see the blur effect. If neither of these are installed, the program will still run fine but blur effects will not be visible.

This basically means you can use Ember in any project you want, but if you make any changes or additions to Ember itself, those must be released with a compatible license. Closed source and commercial games are fine.

This library is dependent on [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) / [Pygame CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce), which both also use the [GNU LGPL version 2.1](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html) license at the time of writing.
