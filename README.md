# Ember

# WIP. This isn't meant to be used yet.

Ember is a UI library for [Pygame CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce). Learn how to get started on the docs page.

# Installation

# Dependencies

Requires:

- Python 3.11 or later.

- [Pygame CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) v 2.2.0 or later. Upstream Pygame is not supported.

# License 

This library is distributed under [GNU LGPL version 2.1](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html), which can be found in the file `LICENCE.txt`. We reserve the right to place future versions of this library under a different license.

This basically means you can use Ember in any project you want, but if you make any changes or additions to Ember itself, those must be released with a compatible license. Closed source and commercial games are fine.

This library is dependent on [Pygame CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce), which also uses the [GNU LGPL version 2.1](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html) license at the time of writing.
