Ember Documentation
===================================================

**THIS LIBRARY AND THIS DOCUMENTATION AND ARE A WIP. DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY (for now).**

Ember is a UI library built for `Pygame CE <https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce>`_. It allows you to build user interfaces using declarative syntax. Our aim is to build a library that is as easy to get to grips with as possible, but also fully customisable.

Ember is currently in alpha, and is likely to be unstable. If you find a bug, or there's a particular feature you want to see, feel free to `create an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/Sjmarf/ember/issues>`_ if one does not already exist. We make no promises of backwards compatibility at this time - features may be changed or removed without warning.

Features
---------------
- Customisable appearance, including support for pixel art
- Declarative, easy-to-read syntax
- UI that adapts to the size of the window
- Keyboard and controller navigation
